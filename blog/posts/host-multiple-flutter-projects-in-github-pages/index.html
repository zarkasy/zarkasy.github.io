For example, flutter is very good to build beautiful UI and simple game using Flame Engine, I felt that flutter was so natural to build pretty UI, but if you want to build app that leveraging native API such as WebRTC, GeoFencing, Geotracking, you have to do your research before pouring your time and energy into Flutter.

To host your Flutter app into github pages you need to generate the web output from flutter using this command.\nflutter build web For the HomePageProject which is Flutter project, i just genereated it using the command above, but for the second project which is this app there are few steps todo.\nCreate subfolder inside root project.
