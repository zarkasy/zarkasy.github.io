Yesterday I [wrote](https://aplikasihebat.com/blog/posts/confusing-google-play-console-review/) about my little bit frustation about Google Play App Review proces, altough I admin the tittle was a little bit confusing. Also yesterday evening I got notification that my last updates has been approved, thanks God.

I got a suspicion about which part of my app violated the terms of Google Play. In the [v1.10.0](https://aplikasihebat.com/blog/posts/rilis-v1.10.0-aplikasi-baca-tanpa-eja/) updates I changed the Home UI a little, first I changed the Premium button's text from Remove Ads into Premium. I am hoping with this positive tone, more users will convert into premium user. Another change was I removed the Rate Us button's text into Icon only butotn using Star image. I remebered thinking into saving some spaces and also making my home view more neat. If my assumption is correct, I think this is the reason why my v1.10.0 updates got prolonged review process. I remember it took 21 days before I decided to pull it out and try again.
