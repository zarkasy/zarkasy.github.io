Yesterday I [wrote](https://aplikasihebat.com/blog/posts/confusing-google-play-console-review/) about my little bit frustation about Google Play App Review proces, altough I admin the tittle was a little bit confusing. Also yesterday evening I got notification that my last updates has been approved, thanks God.

I got a suspicion about which part of my app violated the terms of Google Play. In the [v1.10.0](https://aplikasihebat.com/blog/posts/rilis-v1.10.0-aplikasi-baca-tanpa-eja/) updates I changed the Home UI a little, first I changed the Premium button's text from Remove Ads into Premium. I am hoping with this positive tone, more users will convert into premium user. Another change was I removed the Rate Us button's text into Icon only butotn using Star image. I remebered thinking into saving some spaces and also making my home view more neat. If my assumption is correct, I think this is the reason why my v1.10.0 updates got prolonged review process. I remember it took 21 days before I decided to pull it out and try again.

From this I will summarize some points.
1. Google play review process is obscure and you need to have a good guessing game and good at finding someone elses experience regarding this.
2. If your review process took more than 7 days, then try to review it yourself if you made mistakes.
3. Always have save points to compare your current and prevs versions of your app to help you guessing your errors.
4. Do not make an appeal because it will only make it worse, many cases end up their app got removed and their account suspended.
