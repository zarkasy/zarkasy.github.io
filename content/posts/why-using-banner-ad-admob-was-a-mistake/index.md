It's been a while since I published my [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aplikasihebat.baca_app&pcampaignid=web_share) into Play Store, and since then I've been implemented Admob for one of my source of income. There are two types of Ads I used in my App, first is Interstitial Ad, and second is Banner Ad. Interstitial Ad is the first format I implemented, and I've experenced some issues with it, for example when I miss implemented it by made my app making request to Admob server too frequently, and my account got limited by Admob. But after that I can resolve the issue by giving some interval when making ad request. Honestly I like this Ad format because not only it has higher e-cpm also my users like it. What is the reason I can say that my users prefered only interstitial ad compared to the combinations of both.

## The rate of in App Purchase

I remember when I only implemented Interstitial Ad, I got some in App Purchase, but after I implemeneted Banner Ad, I got zero till now. But do not take my words for granted, you've to experimenting by yourself to see what is more suitable for you, but for me I think I will only implement interstitial Ad from now going forward.

Other than above reason, why I dont want to implement Banner Ad anymore is because it only generate little reveneu because a very low ecpm generated by it, more over with Banner Ad, your user interface would be cluttered with ads, altough you can say that banner ad size is very small but also your user device, reasoning from here I can say that my App will be better without this type of Ad because It'll improve user expererince greatly that before.

## Banner Ad is utterly useless

After I implemented Banner Ad, for a while my Ad reveneu keep increasing, but after some time it got reached a point where my reveneu become stagnant and now tend to decreasing. Moreover the user loss for my App keep getting bigger and bigger, even though my App installations also get higher, but using this data I come to a conclusion that my users not very much like the current experiences that they got from my App. As you can see also from pictures above that Banner Ads's ecpm sometimes hit zero compared to Interstitial ecpm that went quite steady.

With this data I've decided that implementing banner Ad is not only wasting time but also wasting me money and reducing App quality.
