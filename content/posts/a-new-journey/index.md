Yesterday was an exhausting day, according to Google Fit I walked 7,929 steps, but I think I walked more than that because I didn't always carry my mobile phone. Eventhough, I am still grateful, my work toward building this [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aplikasihebat.baca_app&pcampaignid=web_share) gives me some hope. Yesterday I got new purchase, after I changed the design of premium button into more positive ones. Previously I wrote *Remove Ads* on the button, now it only writtten *Premium* with diamond icon to the left and purple color as the background. I learned that purple is a premium color, it gives your a sense of exclusivity, I guess it worked, cause immideately a day after the updates I got new purchase.

The learning app has been developed long enough to me, one year and two months, and I learnt tons of new knowledge by doing it, not limited to programming but also business in general. I am not hinting I will stop develop it, but maybe with 22 menus already, now its time to move to the next project. I will still continue to add new games or menus, but big proportions of my time will be utilise into the next project. 

By develpoing this app, I am gone from optimist into realist. I was an optimist because this was the first app I published commercially, not entirely true but in sense of a very well made product that I can be proud of. And I become a realist knowing that my app growth will be slow and gradual and I cannot depending into one project only. Time to move on.
