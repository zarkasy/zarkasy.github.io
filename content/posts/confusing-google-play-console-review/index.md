So basically this is the first post that differ from previous posts where usually I posted about updates for my [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aplikasihebat.baca_app&pcampaignid=web_share). I am a little bit frustated by the review process in Google Play Console, it's too obscure to understand what is wrong.

So at 28 January 2025 I released my latest update into play store. I never have problems with my updates before, or when I have, its very clear what errors I've made and I can fix it immideately, but this case was different, I got no updates whatsoever about my App, I left hanging for about twenty more days before I remove my update and rethink again what I done wrong.

I know as developer publishing app into play store, dont expect to have special treatments if you're not big companies and have alot to bargain, if you're small team of publisher then you need to try to guessing what you done wrong, because when you made an appeal, often from stories I read, your app will get banned or removed.

Now I have re release my update but with some modifications, but I really dont know if this update will get accepted or I will get the same results where I left waiting for tens of days, I hope not.
